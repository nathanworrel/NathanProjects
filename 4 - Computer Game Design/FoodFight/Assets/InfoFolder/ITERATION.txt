The Major problems that we discovered in the last playtesting session:
    There was a spammy aspect to the attack
    Players would run around collecting health and you couldn't catch them
    Players also wouldn't use the powerups as much as intended
    Juice and throwable item

How we fixed them over the last week:
    Added a stamina bar to give the game more strategy
    Used the stamina and added a sprint meter to allow for more movement
    Added 4 additional powerups and placed them around the map
    Added a throwable item to the game
    Added additional particle affects
    Bug fixes so you cant climb up the walls and more
