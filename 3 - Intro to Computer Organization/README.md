## Introduction to Computer Organization

This course explores how computers execute programs by examining both hardware and software interactions.

### Course Goals
- Understand the hardware/software process behind program execution
- Learn how high-level languages (e.g., C++) translate to low-level operations
- Explore how hardware components are organized to form a working computer

### Key Topics and Skills
- Fundamentals of how computers execute programs
- Hardware building blocks and their roles in a computer system
- Describing hardware using:
  - Diagrams
  - Finite-state machines
  - Hardware simulators (written in C)
- Writing and understanding low-level programs using Assembly language
