# NathanSchoolProjects

Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my repository—a curated collection of projects I completed during my three years in college. These projects reflect my growth as a developer and the range of topics I explored throughout my academic journey.

### 📚 Project Organization

The course numbering follows a loose structure:
- Courses in the **3s** indicate *junior-level* classes 
- Courses in the **4s** indicate *senior-level* classes 

I’ve intentionally excluded introductory (1s) and sophomore-level projects(2s), as I feel they no longer feel reflect my current abilities as a developer. To keep things concise and relevant, I’ve also curated my project list to highlight work that best aligns with my current skills and aspirations.

### 💡 How to Navigate the Projects

I recommend opening the projects in an IDE like Intellij or VSCode to best explore and understand the code. 
Some include the original problem statements, while others feature recreated documentation I wrote to help explain the purpose and goals of the work.

You'll also find my **Automated Stock Trading Personal Project** included in a trimmed-down format. This version showcases my current coding practices and development workflow. Sensitive elements (such as secrets or private logic) have been removed for privacy and security.
